## General
Any personally identifying information we retain will not be used for any purpose other than to provide functionality on this website. **We will not pass your information on unless legally required to do so.**

## Information we collect
We use Google Analytics to monitor statistics about the viewership so that we may better tailor the content to you, the visitor. We have configured Google Analytics to;

  * Anonymise your personally identifying information
  * Respect any [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) headers you pass along with your requests
  * Not use cookies to identify you to the site but instead use short lived session storage

When logging in to comment via one of the three authentication providers we request the minimum of information to provide the commenting functionality. This includes a way to identify you as a user of the commenting functionality and where possible a profile image to associate with your commenting identity. 

This information is retained for the express purpose of providing the commenting functionality. It will not be used for any other purpose. 

**As per the requirements of the GDPR you are able to request the deletion of your commenting information, as well as your full comment history by utilising the built in functions of the commenting system.**

## Information _others_ may collect
This website uses third party scripts to embed content from third party websites, namely;

  * [youtube.com](https://youtube.com)
  * [twitter.com](https://twitter.com)
  * [instagram.com](https://instagram.com)
  * [vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com)

Where possible this functionality is configured in such a way that the third parties have minimal access to your information. Interaction with the third party content (such as playing an embedded video) will allow the third parties to track you as if you had visited their websites.
