## A (super) brief history

My personal blog has been about in various forms for quite a long time now, and I post to it less than I'd like. It began it's life as a wordpress blog - something which I, as a PHP developer, was quite comfortable with. You can find all the details about how I migrated to this [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) based site in [this post]({{% relref "post/2018-11-20-welcome-to-the-new-realmenweardress.es" %}}) from late 2018[^1]. 

[^1]: On a technical note, I no longer use webpack for the site as Huge has  implemented a fully integrated asset building pipeline and bundling mechanism. If you want to build a static site I would absolutely recommend taking a look at Hugo.

## Why the name?

<div class="is-clearfix">
{{< figure src="WoWScrnShot_013026_162118_crop.jpg" class="image is-quarter is-pullout-right" alt="A screenshot from the game 'World of Warcraft'. It shows a white bearded dwarf character wearing red, white and gold battle armour. The armour features overly large pauldrons and a floor length dress." caption="This guy in his armoured dress ready to beat on various large monsters." >}}

Back when I started this blog I was roughly 2 years into a (still ongoing[^2]) World of Warcraft gaming hobby. My character of choice in those days was a Dwarf Paladin.

[^2]: There have been breaks, but I keep coming back. Mostly because I have life long friends that do the same and it's a way we get to spend time together despite being spread over europe.

Throughout the years Paladins have had numerous aesthetics but at the time it was all about the floor length armoured dresses and so consequently this blog got the name RealMenWearDress.es. 

Now, of course, it's all about being a honking great armoured cow that transforms into a cat. Maybe I should figure out a new name.

## What do you write about?

This place is fundamentally a dumping ground for what I happen to feel like writing about at the time. Initially that was pretty much all World of Warcraft related, then it was gaming in general but lately it's moved into technical things I note down when dealing with my homelab. Generally you're going to get a bit of everything.
