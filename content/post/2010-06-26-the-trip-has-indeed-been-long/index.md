I'd like to thank all the people who'd made the last year as enjoyable as it has been. Despite having been playing this game for over a year now I've still got so much to see and do &#8211; so for that I'd like to thank blizzard, but not for [The Turkinator](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=3578) for that they can all go sit in the naughty corner.
