Apologies for the GIF but it is rather appropriate. I'm itching to know of all the gameplay adjustments and tweaks made for Warlords of Draenor but I can't bring myself to look at sites such as mmochampion &#8211; I know in amongst all these nuggets of useful knowledge there are going to be some horrendous gameplay spoilers. I was a part of the Cataclysm beta and although it was a hoot it did significantly diminish the fun I had when running through the content for a second time. I was about as spoiled as you can get.

Some of my favourite games are heavily story based, it's something I enjoy immensely. Recently I've played through the new Tomb Raider, The Last of Us and Uncharted 2. In the past it's been Half-Life (1, 2 and episodes) as well as a great many others.

All of these games are fun because stories are fun and if I end up learning all the stories for Warlords from a comment on an article that explains changes to my Holy Paladins class I'm going to be mighty pissed. **So I am left with one option**.

Live in a WoW free internet bubble for the next few months. Great.
