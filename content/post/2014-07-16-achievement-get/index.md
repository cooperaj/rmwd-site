This expansion has ended on a high note for me thanks to my awesome girlfriend and [Openraid](http://openraid.org). I've managed to get my '[Ahead of the Curve](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=8399)' as well as the meta and the challenge mode silver rewards. This is all awesome and to me at least feels like a great place to be going into Warlords.
