With the changes Blizzard have implemented in the pre-expansion patch I've re-found Diablo. Loot drops &#8211; lots of them, quick leveling and a configurable difficulty that means I can be punished for my mistakes and not walk around like I'm some sort demi-god which realistically gets boring very quickly.

I was indifferent to [Reaper of Souls](http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/reaper-of-souls/)Â but now I'm definitely looking forward to playing it.
