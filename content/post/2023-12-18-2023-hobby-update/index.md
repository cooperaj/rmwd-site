This year, despite spending a silly amount of money on Games Workshop products (subscriptions, magazines, 10th edition rules and datacards, a few models), I played precisely __two__ shortend games[^1]. I also spent about 5 hours or so painting. 

Given the money spent this is not really acceptable so I need to have a serious ponder about what to do. I figured writing it down here for the world to see might give me some momentum.

The first image of Geordi show him holding his hand out in a gesture of warning, the accompanying text reads 'getting hobby stuff done'. The second image shows Georgi pointing his fingure in a gesture of recognition and encouragement, the accompanying text reads 'getting hobby stuff done.'" >}}

Next year I'm going to get it done. I've a Necron combat patrol to paint up[^2] (I need those "battle ready" 10 victory point bonuses) and games will be scheduled to be played. I live 30 minutes from Warhammer World so I have exactly no excuse not to be playing on awesome fully painted terrain.

### Images from the year + a visit to the Warhammer World Exhibition

[^1]: My group consists of three people and we all turned up. So two, two turn, games it is.
[^2]: Well, almost an entire Indomitus box, and loads of Orks... and Deathguard.... and terrain but baby steps.
