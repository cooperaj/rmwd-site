As detailed in [my last post](http://realmenweardress.es/2012/12/my-christmas-project/ "My Christmas Project") my World of Warcraft project for this Christmas break was to get my bank alt Gnome to level 80 for a Herald of the Titans run that'll be happening sometime later this year.

Unfortunately I did not commit the necessary time to the project to get it done. I did however get him 13 more levels up to a nice 53. About halfway through I was informed that I really should have him in a guild with all the leveling perks and was hindering things by keeping him in my banking guild 'The Royal Bank of Grokk'.

A quick switcheroo later and I'm now soaking up the perks. What a nub.
