Meet Grokknome; he's the character I created to make some real money on the AH. Actually, scratch that, he was originally created for a level 1 gnome hogger raid. You know, before they nerfed that particular piece of fun. If I recall correctly the 40 or so of us that had gathered managed to kill hogger just fine—we then went on a tour of Dalaran before jumping out of the sewer pipe in some sort of mass Gnomish suicide pact.

After all this I found that I'd become rather attached to the fellow; I mean, how can you not, with his bald head, jug ears and tasty goatee/tache combo. From that day forward he became my trusty AH (dis)enchanter companion. He's not always camped out in front of the Dwarfen <del datetime="2010-07-19T14:22:25+00:00">hottie</del>auctioneer either as I regularly find him ganking healers in [Warsong Gulch](http://www.wowhead.com/zone=3277).

But now I suppose I've come to the crux of this whole article. Despite not playing on a Role Play realm—despite not ever being interested in that kind of thing before now—I find myself properly identifying with this little guy's personality. He's a shameless, cheeky, womanising scamp who'll _/flirt_ at anything female and has a particular liking for women of the Dwarfen kind. He's had more then a few _/slap_'s, and will usually evoke at least a _/gasp_ or a _/blush_ (all in-game emotes I might add, the line is drawn at harassing pixels). The thing is, I don't know why I do it&mdash;I really haven't a clue; perhaps it's the way he dances?

But all this has got me thinking&mdash;I can't be the only one. Can I?
